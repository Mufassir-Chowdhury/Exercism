# Exercism
This is a personal (but public) repository for all of my solutions to the problems from the Website [Exercism](www.exercism.io "Exercism is an independent not-for-profit organisation, run by a small team, and supported by 1,832 wonderful volunteers.").\
Currently I have included the following languages:
1. C
2. C++ (Completed the main track)
3. Python
4. Rust
5. Java
6. Javascript
7. Dart

I am looking forward to adding more languages to this list. 
> Even if a folder is included here doesn't imply I have completed that exercise. This means I have unlocked and currently working on that problem.
#### Hope it helps!
